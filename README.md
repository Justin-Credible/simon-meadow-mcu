# Meadow MCU Simon Game

This is a toy project for the [Meadow F7v2 Feather](https://store.wildernesslabs.co/collections/frontpage/products/meadow-f7-feather) microcontroller by [Wildreness Labs](https://www.wildernesslabs.co/).

It is a [Simon game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) clone I built for an Easter themed project.
